# The Idea Book

Hello there! This is my Node/Express web application I made as part of the Udemy course I completed, which can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/nodejs-express-mongodb-dev-to-deployment

This crud application is powered by Node.js and a MongoDB database. The purpose of the application is to create an online depository for noting down ideas whilst on the go.

Hope you enjoy!
